Data graph is on the left pane, shapes graph in the right one.

Exercise 1 (5 min):
-Using Data 1 and Shapes 1,  fix the shape graph to validate the data
-Add rules to validate the datatypes for foaf:givenName, foaf:familyName and foaf:name as xsd:string.
-(Advanced) Do the same but with just one property shape, using sh:alternativePath

Exercise 2 (10 min)
-Using Data 2 and Shapes 2, add a constraint to ensure that each laurate has at least one dbo:affiliation to some dbo:University
-Add another shape to verify that the values of dbp:dateOfBirth and foaf:birthday are the same for all laureates
-(Advanced) Use qualified shapes to verify that at least one dbo:affiliation to a dbo:University, but allowing other affiliations as well

Exercise 3 (10 min)
-Using Data 3 and Shapes 3, create property shapes that validate foaf:name, foaf:givenName and foaf:familyName with regular expressions using sh:pattern. Names should not be allowed to be shorter than two characters and must not contain underscores or numbers.
-Add a constraint that requires all laureate awards to have a nobel:motivation that is a string of 10 characters or more. Allow only one motivation per language tag.
